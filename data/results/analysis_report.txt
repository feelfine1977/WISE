       - Timeline: 6 Weeks

3. **Address Low Performers (Plastic Additives - Other, Process Automation & Instrumentation, Course Surfaces)**:
   - **Task 3.1**: Root-Cause Analysis.
       - Investigation: Identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
       - Timeline: 4 Weeks
   - **Task 3.2**: Redesign Processes.
       - Execution: Revise processes, provide necessary training.
       - Timeline: 8 Weeks

4. **Improve Scores for Specific Heatmap Insights**:
   - **Task 4.1**: Improve Digital Marketing (Sequential Case ID and Singular Case ID).
       - Action: Review and align process tasks sequence, eliminate duplicates.
       - Timeline: 5 Weeks
   - **Task 4.2**: Enhance Standard PO and EC Purchase Order.
       - Action 4.2.1: Analyze and Resolve Outliers in Standard PO.
           - Performance Review: Identify and correct outliers root causes.
           - Timeline: 4 Weeks
       - Action 4.2.2: Increase Consistency in EC Purchase Order.
           - Task Review: Align low-performing scores closer to high performers.
           - Timeline: 6 Weeks

5. **Consistency and Variability Reduction**:
   - **Task 5.1**: Detailed Analysis for High Variability Categories.
       - Analysis: Investigate and document reasons for variability.
       - Timeline: 3 Weeks
   - **Task 5.2**: Implement Controls to Reduce Variability.
       - Controls: Standardize tasks, employ checklists, and real-time metrics monitoring.
       - Timeline: 6 Weeks

6. **Establish Continuous Monitoring & Improvement**:
   - **Task 6.1**: Develop a Continuous Monitoring Plan.
       - Tools: Implement automated tracking systems and dashboards.
       - Timeline: 4 Weeks
   - **Task 6.2**: Regular Performance Reviews.
       - Review Cycle: Monthly reviews to track and sustain improvements.
       - Timeline: Ongoing

### Performance Metrics to Track

- **Mean Score**: Target > 0.8 for all categories.
- **Variability**: Achieve low variability (<0.1) in high performing categories and medium.
- **Scores by Dimension**:
  - **Correct Order of Activities (Sequential Case ID)**: > 0.8
  - **Absence of Duplicate Activities (Singular Case ID)**: > 0.8
  - **Presence of Mandatory Activities (Found Case ID)**: Maintain > 0.9
  - **Absence of Unwanted Activities (Exclusion Case ID)**: Increase to > 0.8

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Involve category managers and process experts in improvement design and implementation.
   - Timeline: Throughout project duration

2. **Leverage Technology**:
   - Utilize automation and advanced analytics for enhanced efficiency and monitoring.
   - Timeline: Immediately start and integrate over 6 Months

3. **Training Programs**:
   - Conduct regular training focused on areas with scores < 0.8 and high variability.
   - Review and update training material based on process changes and improvements.
   - Timeline: 2 Weeks setup, ongoing execution

### Conclusion

The step-by-step plan focuses on leveraging strengths, enhancing medium performers, addressing low performers, and establishing continuous improvement mechanisms. Consistent monitoring and stakeholder collaboration will ensure sustained performance improvements across all categories.
