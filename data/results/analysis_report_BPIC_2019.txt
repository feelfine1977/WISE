   - **Focus:** MR0 (Components), Office Supplies.
   - **Actions:**
     - Enhance process documentation.
     - Standardize workflows.
     - Provide targeted training.
     - Target score improvement to ≥ 0.8 for `score_sequential_case_id`.

#### 3. Load Balancing
   - **Focus:** Technical Services, Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC).
   - **Actions:**
     - Redistribute tasks evenly.
     - Utilize process mining techniques.
     - Aim to improve `score_equilibrium_case_id` from < 0.6 to ≥ 0.8.

#### 4. Elimination of Unnecessary Activities
   - **Focus:** Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC), Pure Resins & Pigments.
   - **Actions:**
     - Employ lean methodologies to identify/remove non-value-adding activities.
     - Increase `score_exclusion_case_id` from < 0.4 to ≥ 0.75.

#### 5. Monitoring and Control
   - **General Actions:**
     - Implement real-time monitoring dashboards for all categories.
     - Regularly track process performance.

### Next Steps Plan:

#### 1. Diagnostics Phase
   - **Actions:**
     - Perform root cause analysis for low-performing categories.
     - Aim for score improvement from mean ≤ 0.4 to ≥ 0.6 within the next quarter.
     - Interview key stakeholders for insights.

#### 2. Action Planning:
   - **Actions:**
     - Develop specific action plans for each category's issues.
     - Prioritize high-impact areas for immediate improvement.
     - Example Priority: Raise `score_found_case_id` in Office Supplies from < 0.6 to ≥ 0.8.

#### 3. Implementation:
   - **Actions:**
     - Roll out standardization protocols and training sessions.
     - Implement load balancing strategies.
     - Integrate process automation.
     - Target `score_singular_case_id`: Increase from < 0.4 to ≥ 0.7.

#### 4. Monitoring & Review:
   - **Actions:**
     - Set up continuous monitoring mechanisms with KPIs.
     - Conduct monthly reviews of performance data.
     - Iterate on improvements based on data.
     - Example: Raise `score_sequential_case_id` in DRUM 5 from a wide range to consistent ≥ 0.75.

### Quantifiable Performance Metrics:
1. **Overall Target:** Increase mean scores across all low-performing categories from ≤ 0.4 to ≥ 0.6 within 6 months.
2. **Specific Focus Areas:**
   - `score_found_case_id`: Improve Office Supplies from < 0.6 to ≥ 0.8.
   - `score_sequential_case_id`: Consistency in MR0, aim for scores of ≥ 0.8.
   - `score_equilibrium_case_id`: Balance workload in IBC, improve from < 0.6 to ≥ 0.8.
   - `score_exclusion_case_id`: Reduce non-value-adding activities in Pure Resins & Pigments, improve from < 0.4 to ≥ 0.75.
3. **High Performers:** Maintain scores close to 1 and conduct regular audits for consistent performance.

By following these focused steps, overall process effectiveness can be significantly enhanced, resulting in higher efficiency and better resource utilization.
